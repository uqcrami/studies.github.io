        <p>Dear Participant,</p>
        <p>Thank you for your interest in participating in this research project. Please read the following information about the project so that you can decide whether you would like to take part in this research. Please feel free to ask any questions you might have about our involvement in the project.</p>
        <p>If you decide to participate in this research, please keep in mind that your participation is voluntary. If you do not wish to take part, you do not have to. If you decide to take part and later change your mind, you are free to stop at any time, and you would not need to give any explanation for your decision to stop participating. If you choose to stop participating, your data will not be used in the research.</p>

        <h2>What is this research about?</h2>
        <p>The objective of this study is to investigate how basic forms can evoke emotional responses from human observers. We aim to employ a novel analytical approach to examine the results, with the goal of identifying key expressive characteristics. This analysis will contribute to refining our understanding of expressivity in artificial agents. Additionally, we seek to determine how expressivity is manifested within the constraints of limited agent capabilities.</p>
    
        <h2>What will I need to do?</h2>
        <p>If you agree to participate, we require from you the following:</p>
        <ul>

            <li><b>Have access to a computer with Google Chrome browser</b></li>
            <li><b>You will be asked to watch 6 videos, lasting no longer than 30 seconds each, then describe what you see, and respond to several questions.</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your participation will be paid at a rate of <b>&pound;9 (GBP) per hour</b> and should not extend past <b>20 minutes.</b></p>
        <p>Your participation in this study is <b>ENTIRELY VOLUNTARY.</b></p>
        <p>You have the right to withdraw from the study at any time without providing any reason. Remuneration will be paid only for completed studies.</p>
